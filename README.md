# QR Me!

## Concept

You just met a new friend and want to exchange contact info! But who wants to vocally spell out their email address or whatever?

Here's QR Me! Enter your info in the website, and press "QR Me!" to create a QR code with your info in it.

Your friend can then scan it on their phone, and their phone will create a new contact for you!

Your info and recent QR codes are stored locally so that you can easily visit the website and reuse them.
