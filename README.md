# QR Me!

## ðŸ’¡ Concept

Imagine that you just met a new friend and want to exchange contact info! But who wants to vocally spell out their phone number or email?

Instead, use QR Me! As you enter your info in the website, a QR code will be created with that info inside it.

Your new friend can then scan it on their phone, which will create a new contact for you!
